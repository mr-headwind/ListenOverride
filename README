 DESCRIPTION
 -----------
    ListenOverride has come about because of an issue that has been introduced
    with a change to the network code in the Linux kernel. 
    THIS IS NOT A CRITICISM OF THE CHANGES MADE.
    However, a proposed patch to remedy the problem was rejected with the expectation
    that changes to applications failing would have to be made. 
    In my case, the application failing is the Epson network plugin for scanners.
    The only problem with fixing this is that I / We do not have access the Epson network 
    plugin code and Epson thus far have not been helpful.

    Hence, the need to work around the problem...

 HOW TO SETUP THE WORKAROUND
 ---------------------------
    The git homepage for ListenOverride is located at:

    	https://github.com/mr-headwind/ListenOverride

    .  Download or clone the code package files to a suitable directory (eg. ~/Dev/ListenOverride).
    .  Open a Terminal or xterm
    .  cd ~/Dev/ListenOverride
    .  Compile the source and build the library. Instructions are commented in the code files.
    .  cd /usr/lib/iscan
    .  sudo cp -p network orig_network
    .  sudo cp ~/Dev/ListenOverride/listen_override.so . 
    .  sudo cp ~/Dev/ListenOverride/network . 
    .  Ensure files are executable (sudo chmod 755 *) if necessary
    .  Start the scanner and test
